    \opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}
    
    I am writing to you on behalf of the Wikipedia project,
    an endeavour to build a fully-fledged multilingual encyclopaedia in an entirely
    open manner, to ask for permission to use your copyrighted material.

    \duckthink[duck-family,body-mirrored,body-align=r]{Wellcome!}

    That said, allow me to reiterate that your material will be used to the noble end of
    providing a free collection of knowledge for everyone; naturally enough, only if you
    agree. If that is the case, could you kindly fill in the attached form and post it
    back to me? We shall greatly appreciate it.

    Thank you for your time and consideration.

    I look forward to your reply.
    
    \closing{Yours Faithfully,}
